The files in this repo contains MS Office scripts that I have developped over time to improve my efficiency in working with the MS Office suite. 

## how to use the Excel Scripts

1. Open the visual basic editor by pressing Alt + F11
2. In the project window, expand the Personal.xlsx file
3. Copy the content of the Excel scripts file and paste in to the Code Editor
4. Now you can access these scripts using the "Macros" button within any workbook.
